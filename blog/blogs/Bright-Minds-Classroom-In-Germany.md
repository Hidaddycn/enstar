title: Bright Minds | Classroom In Germany
description: A German primary school has upgraded all 30 classrooms with 40 W LED panels  The panels emit a gentle, glare-free light that minimizes eye strain and fatigue—ideal for students who spend long days indoors. Their high efficiency cuts annual lighting electricity use by 58 %, freeing enough budget to purchase 2,00 new textbooks each year while also lowering the school’s carbon footprint.
